The index.html file provides some initial context about the project. It seems to be a web application named "BUNTHEON - Educational Companion", potentially related to Telegram Web Apps and capable of rendering mathematical formulas using KaTeX.

Now, let's examine the package.json file to understand the project's dependencies and scripts. This will give us more insights into the technologies used and the development process.

The package.json file confirms that this is a React application built with Vite.
Here are some key observations:

Dependencies:

React and React DOM: Core React libraries for building the UI.
react-router-dom: For handling routing and navigation within the application.
lucide-react: A library of icons, likely used for UI elements.
katex, react-latex-next, remark-math, rehype-katex: Libraries for rendering mathematical formulas, confirming the KaTeX integration hinted at in index.html.
react-markdown: For rendering Markdown content, suggesting the app might display or handle Markdown text.
date-fns: A date utility library, likely used for date formatting and manipulation.
DevDependencies:

Vite: The build tool and development server.

Based on these files, it seems like we are dealing with a React-based educational application that uses:

Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
Functionality: Routing, Iconography, Markdown rendering, Mathematical formula rendering, Date utilities.
Target Platform: Telegram Web Apps (based on index.html and project name)

The src/main.tsx file is quite simple, as expected for a standard React entry point. It does the following:

Imports StrictMode from React for enabling strict mode in development.
Imports createRoot from react-dom/client for rendering the React application.
Imports the main App component from ./App.tsx.
Imports the global styles from ./index.css.
Renders the App component inside the <div id="root"> element in index.html, wrapped in StrictMode.
This confirms that src/App.tsx is the main component that defines the application's structure and routing.

The src/App.tsx file defines the main application structure and routing using react-router-dom.

Key Components and Structure:

BrowserRouter (Router): Enables client-side routing for the application.
Routes and Route: Define the application's routes and map them to specific components.
TelegramProvider: A context provider from ./contexts/TelegramContext. This suggests the application uses a Telegram context to manage Telegram Web Apps related functionalities.
Layout Component: A layout component from ./components/Layout. This likely provides the basic structure and common UI elements for all pages.
Pages: Several page components are imported from ./pages/*:
Home: The homepage of the application.
AIChat: Likely an AI chat feature.
PromptLibrary: A library of prompts, possibly for AI or educational purposes.
Dictionary: A dictionary feature.
ExamPapers: A section for exam papers.
Reminders: A reminders feature.
Routing Configuration:

The application uses nested routes. The Layout component wraps all main pages.
The root path / renders the Layout and the Home component as the index page.
Other paths like /ai-chat, /prompts, /dictionary, /exam-papers, and /reminders are defined for different features, all using the Layout component.
This structure suggests a single-page application with a common layout and navigation, featuring several educational tools or resources.

The Layout component (src/components/Layout.tsx) provides the structural layout for the application and handles Telegram Web App specific functionalities.

Key Features:

Telegram Context: It uses useTelegram hook from ../contexts/TelegramContext to access Telegram Web App context, including themeParams and webApp.
Routing Outlet: It uses Outlet from react-router-dom to render the child routes (pages) within the layout.
Navigation Component: It includes the Navigation component from ./Navigation for handling application navigation.
Telegram Back Button:
It conditionally shows the Telegram Web App back button when the current path is not the home page (/).
It hides the back button on the home page.
It handles the back button click to navigate back in the history using navigate(-1).
Telegram Theme Integration:
It uses themeParams from the Telegram context to dynamically set CSS variables for background color, text color, hint color, link color, button color, and button text color.
This ensures the application's theme adapts to the Telegram Web App theme.
Basic Structure:
It uses a div with min-h-screen to ensure the layout takes up at least the full screen height.
It applies background and text colors using CSS variables derived from the Telegram theme.
It uses a container class (likely from Tailwind CSS) to center and constrain the content width.
It includes a main element for the page content (using Outlet) and the Navigation component below the main content.
In summary, the Layout component provides the basic visual structure of the application, integrates with the Telegram Web App environment for theme and back button functionality, and renders the navigation and page content.

The TelegramContext.tsx file defines a React context (TelegramContext) to provide Telegram Web App functionalities and data throughout the application.

Key Components:

TelegramWebApp Interface: Defines the structure and methods of the Telegram.WebApp object, based on the Telegram Web Apps API. This includes methods like ready, expand, close, properties for MainButton, BackButton, themeParams, and initDataUnsafe.
TelegramContextType Interface: Defines the structure of the context value, including:
webApp: The Telegram Web App object (TelegramWebApp | null).
user: User information from Telegram (user | null).
themeParams: Theme parameters from Telegram (themeParams | null).
TelegramContext: Creates a React context using createContext with a default value of null for webApp, user, and themeParams.
useTelegram Hook: A custom hook useTelegram that uses useContext(TelegramContext) to easily access the Telegram context values in components.
TelegramProvider Component:
A provider component TelegramProvider that wraps the application and makes the Telegram context available to its children.
It uses useState to manage the webApp, user, and themeParams states.
In a useEffect hook, it initializes the Telegram Web App:
Gets the Telegram.WebApp object from window.Telegram.
Calls tg.ready() and tg.expand() to initialize the Web App.
Sets the webApp, user, and themeParams states using data from the tg object.
It provides the context value using TelegramContext.Provider, passing the webApp, user, and themeParams states.
Functionality:
